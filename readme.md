In this course, I created a static youtube clone that links to the real website and content when clicked. This clone merely copies the aesthetic of youtube in order to gain familiarity in common html and css topics. I learned html and css topics such as grids, flexboxes, divs, more advanced css selectors, creating fixed sidebars and headers, floating icons, and more.

[My Project](https://github.com/avary8/full-stack-training-courses/tree/main/javascript-course)

In this course, I followed along through almost 30 core concepts of JavaScript. I dedicated a file to each concept I believed needed hands-on practice. As a result, I have over 10 example files with important concepts. As a side project, I designed my HTML file to link to each example JS files when clicked upon along with a way to return to the index.
