[My Project](https://github.com/avary8/full-stack-training-courses/tree/main/html-css-course)

In this course, I created a static youtube clone that links to the real website and content when clicked. This clone merely copies the aesthetic of youtube in order to gain familiarity in common html and css topics. I learned html and css topics such as grids, flexboxes, divs, more advanced css selectors, creating fixed sidebars and headers, floating icons, and more.
