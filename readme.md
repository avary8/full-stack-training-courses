## HTML CSS
[Course Used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3e-cpL7ofc)  
[My Project](https://github.com/avary8/full-stack-training-courses/tree/main/html-css-course)

In this course, I created a static youtube clone that links to the real website and content when clicked. This clone merely copies the aesthetic of youtube in order to gain familiarity in common html and css topics. I learned html and css topics such as grids, flexboxes, divs, more advanced css selectors, creating fixed sidebars and headers, floating icons, and more.

## JavaScript

[My Project](https://github.com/avary8/full-stack-training-courses/tree/main/javascript-course)

In this course, I followed along through almost 30 core concepts of JavaScript. I dedicated a file to each concept I believed needed hands-on practice. As a result, I have over 10 example files with important concepts. As a side project, I designed my HTML file to link to each example JS files when clicked upon, along with a way to return to the index.

## Node.js MongoDB
[Course Used](https://youtu.be/f2EqECiTBL8?si=80VHbTteWDvIE1yb)  
[My Project](https://github.com/avary8/full-stack-training-courses/tree/main/node.js-course)

In this course, I first created a basic webserver with just node.js. Following through the tutorial, I used Express.js, MongoDB, and learned core API concepts to create a user and employee API.   
Some topics covered were Express.js, MVC (model view controller) design pattern, CRUD operations, middleware, controllers, route handling, authorization, JWT authentication, user roles, and MongoDB.

## Twitter Clone 
[My Project](https://github.com/avary8/full-stack-training-courses/tree/main/node.js-twitter-clone)

Using the tutorials and skills learned so far, I created a simplified Twitter-esque clone using the MERN stack (without React). This text based posting website allows users to input a username (if desired) and a text to post. Each post is saved into MongoDB and uploaded to the front-end where the username, text, and date posted is displayed. This site features two buttons that will either scroll to the oldest or newest post.
