# Some notable info

### shorthand: 
    4    padding: top right bottom left
    3    padding: top right+left bottom
    2    padding: top+bottom right+left
    1    padding: all 4

        margin: top right bottom left

        orig:   border-width: 1px;
                border-style: solid;
                border-color: rgb(192, 192, 192);
        shorthand:
                border: width style color;

- padding is better than size 

- some things can be inherited such as text features: eg font family

- use google fonts for access to free fonts. (see text.html)

- use divs to break up pages
- every page can be broken up into horizontal and vertical elements

- divs naturally make vertical elements

- divs can make horizontal elements by changing display to inline-block
        and changing the width 


- !!! use display: grid to break up pages neatly !!!

- flex box is another way.
        set flex-direction: to make it row/column 

        - width : 0 to shrink
        - flex-shrink: 0 to not shrink



- higher z index--  makes element appear on top 


- an absolute nested in a fixed will use the dimensions of the fixed as guidelines. (good for buttons in a fixed sidebar/header and stuff)
- absolute can also nest inside a relative . which is good for timestamps on the videos (youtube)
